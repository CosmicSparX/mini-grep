In the realm where memory roams,
Where C once reigned with unchecked thrones,
A language born with fearless grace,
Rust takes its rightful, steady place.

No dangling pointers left to chase,
No undefined, wild, unsafe space.
With lifetimes marked and borrowed clear,
Rust banishes the age-old fear.

Ownership binds with iron clasp,
No race to catch, no threads to grasp.
The compiler stands, a guiding hand,
Ensuring safety, bold and grand.

With zero-cost abstractions spun,
It dances swift, yet weighs a ton.
Concurrency’s no longer cursed—
In Rust, it’s tamed, and well-rehearsed.

From web to systems, all things near,
Rust’s siren call is crystal clear.
A language forged for future’s trust—
Hail to the mighty, enduring Rust!
